  Hi, I'm Juan Carlos Jara. I'm a 28-year-old developer living in Peru. I'm currently  slowly reading
  <a href="http://www.amazon.es/Clean-code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship/dp/0132350882" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Clean Code</a>.
  I've being working building apps using React/Redux/NodeJS and others JS libraries for about 4 years. Before that, I mostly developed web apps(MVC4, C#, JavaScript) from design to deployment, but I also did business process
  modeling and optimization of internal company processes using Engage/Bizagi BPM. <br/>
  I mostly develop my personal projects using JavaScript in all the stack,
  ReactJS/NodeJS and MongoDB. I've done some small projects using Clojure/Clojurescript I would like to keep learning about it because
  I feel that functional programming has a lot to bring to the table and will make me think different about programming.<br/>
  Besides programming, I enjoy programming â˜º, listening to music, traveling, eating delicious food, watching movies and TV series, playing/watching(twitch) dota and hearthstone.<br/>
  I'm looking for a job where I can keep improving my coding skills using pair programming and code review.
