  Hi, I'm Juan Carlos Jara. I'm a full stack javascript developer living in Peru. I'm currently finishing reading 
  <a href="http://www.amazon.es/Clean-code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship/dp/0132350882" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Clean Code</a> 
  and working remotely on Upwork.
  I've been working buildings app using React/Redux/NodeJS/MongoDB and other libraries for around 5 years. <br/><br/>
  I mostly develop my personal projects using JavaScript in all the stack but I like to play around with other languages like python, C. 
  Lately I'm being interesed on Docker and Elastic Search, which I'm currently building a project with. I also enjoy functional languages like 
  Clojure/Clojurescript and I'm interested in learning ELM, I feel that this paradigm make us think differently and it adds a lot of value to a project<br/><br/>
  Besides programming, I enjoy teaching programming, listening to different genres of music, traveling, eating delicious food, watching movies and TV series, 
  playing/watching(twitch tv) Dota 2 and Hearthstone.<br/>
