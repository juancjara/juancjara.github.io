I'm currently  slowly reading <a href=\"http://www.amazon.es/Clean-code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship/dp/0132350882\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Clean Code</a>. I've being working building apps using React/Redux/NodeJS and others JS libraries for about 4 years. Before that, I mostly developed web apps(MVC4, C#, JavaScript) from design to deployment, but I also did business process modeling and optimization of internal company processes using Engage/Bizagi BPM. <br/> I mostly develop my personal projects using JavaScript in all the stack, ReactJS/NodeJS and MongoDB. I've done some small projects using Clojure/Clojurescript I would like to keep learning about it because I feel that functional programming has a lot to bring to the table and will make me think different about programming.<br/> Besides programming, I enjoy programming â˜º, listening to music, traveling, eating delicious food, watching movies and TV series, playing/watching(twitch) dota and hearthstone.<br/> I'm looking for a job where I can keep improving my coding skills using pair programming and code review."},"allProjectsYaml":{"edges":[{"node":{"name":"Portofolio v2","source":null,"preview":null,"summary":"Rebuild my porfolio using gatsby","tags":[{"id":"REACTJS","color":"#03A9F4","label":"ReactJS"},{"id":"GATSBY","color":"#455A64","label":"Gatsby"}]}},{"node":{"name":"Steam achievements","source":null,"preview":null,"summary":"Android app which show off your steam's games and achievements.
