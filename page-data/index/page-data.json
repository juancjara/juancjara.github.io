I'm a full stack javascript developer living in Peru. I'm currently finishing reading  <a href=\"http://www.amazon.es/Clean-code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship/dp/0132350882\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Clean Code</a>  and working remotely on Upwork. I've been working buildings app using React/Redux/NodeJS/MongoDB and other libraries for around 5 years. <br/><br/> I mostly develop my personal projects using JavaScript in all the stack but I like to play around with other languages like python, C.  Lately I'm being interesed on Docker and Elastic Search, which I'm currently building a project with. I also enjoy functional languages like  Clojure/Clojurescript and I'm interested in learning ELM, I feel that this paradigm make us think differently and it adds a lot of value to a project<br/><br/> Besides programming, I enjoy teaching programming, listening to different genres of music, traveling, eating delicious food, watching movies and TV series,  playing/watching(twitch tv) Dota 2 and Hearthstone.<br/>"},"allProjectsYaml":{"edges":[{"node":{"name":"Latest ethereum blocks","source":"https://github.com/juancjara/ethereum-blocks","preview":"https://ethereum-blocks-hmzoukfqrw.now.sh/8169609","summary":"Display latest 10 blocks and transactions from ethereum network","tags":[{"id":"REACTJS","color":"#03A9F4","label":"ReactJS"},{"id":"ETHEREUM","color":"#9E9E9E","label":"Ethereum"}]}},{"node":{"name":"Music drive app","source":"https://github.com/jpalomino1991/music-google-drive","preview":null,"summary":"UNDERCONSTRUCTION - Music player for google drive music.
